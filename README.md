### Install

### Development tools

Install [Xcode 8+][xcode], [ruby][ruby], and [homebrew][homebrew]. 

Then run `./bin/setup`

When adding new files to `Sources/` or `Tests/`, if you're not adding them using Xcode, you can run:

```bash
$ bin/sync-xcode
```

to sync the Xcode project's file references and build sources.

### Testing

Run specs using:

```bash
$ bin/test
```

#### Code Coverage

To generate code coverage, run `./bin/coverage`.

### Linting

To lint the code, run `./bin/lint`.

### Testing push notifications

There are a number of tools to help with this; [Pusher][pusher] is an excellent choice.

#### Publishing XCFramework

Run build xcframework script  ``` ./bin/build_xcframework.sh ```

 This will create an output folder next to the the root folder
 
 ``` ../output/VibesPush.xcframework ``` can be pushed the the public github repo
